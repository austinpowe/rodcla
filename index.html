		<h1>Rodcla</h1>
		<h2>A tall, serif display typeface<br>with human touches<br>designed in Oregon.</h2>

		<h2>
			Rodcla is fancy, yet unpretentious.
		</h2>
		<p>
			The ball terminals on letters like the G, J, Q, S, j, t, and y give Rodcla the ornamentation that a designer would expect from a fancy typeface. However, the straight verticality of the letters like the E, F, H, R, d and l ground the typeface in the world of no-nonsense geometry, keeping Rodcla from pretention or over-decoration.

		<h2>
			It's inviting yet not smothering.
		</h2>
		<p>
			Because Rodcla fits in with other Transitional typefaces due to its variable letter axes and medium stroke contrast, it lacks both the calligraphic qualities of a Humanist serif and the often expensive and exclusive overtones of a Modern typeface. By resting firmly between these two extremes, Rodcla manages to be human and approachable.

		<h2>
			It's personality-driven yet not precocious.
		</h2>
		<p>
			The ball terminals and serifs on Rodcla are some of the typeface&#39;s most distinctive features. These give the letterforms personality and a distinctive dialect, although they are not exaggerated enough to distract from the letterforms themselves, as sometimes happens in novelty faces or overwrought display faces. The small touches add to Rodcla&#39;s charm without overwhelming the reader or becoming ornamentation for ornamentation&#39;s sake.

		<h2>
			It's light yet commanding.
		</h2>
		<p>
			Because Rodcla is meant to be used as a display face, it was designed to be commanding when set at large sizes near body copy. A tall x-height and distinctive personality (as discussed above) give Rodcla the power to speak in the necessary tone for a headline. The typeface does this even though it&#39;s not terribly heavy or thick&mdash;Rodcla makes a good lightweight headline, which especially works as a contrast to other heavy elements on a page.

		<h2>
			It's cute yet not girly. 
		</h2>
		<p>
			The final property of Rodcla is one of the hardest to pin down academically; how does a typeface suggest femininity or masculinity? Letterforms aren&#39;t gendered, but it&#39;s easy to look at Didot and say that it looks feminine while a heavy slab serif like Rockwell communicates masculinity. Rodcla falls into the first camp, but not to the extreme&mdash;Rodcla isn&#39;t a full-on girly face, but it certainly leans that way.
